        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p><span class="fun">Bubble Under </span>is a group of
             diving enthusiasts based in the south-west UK who meet up for diving trips in 
             the summer months when the weather is good and the bacon rolls are flowing. We
              arrange weekends away as small groups to cut the cost of accommodation and travel
               and to ensure that everyone gets a trustworthy dive buddy. </p>
        <p>Although we're based in the south-west UK, we don't stay on our own turf: past diving
             weekends away have included trips up to Scapa Flow in Scotland and to Malta's numerous
              wreck sites.</p>
        <p>When we're not diving, we often meet up in a local pub to talk about our recent
             adventures (<em>any</em> excuse, eh?).</p>
        <p>Or as our man Jack Fisher would put it:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p class="fun">"Happiness is a dip in the ocean followed by a pint or two of Old Speckled 
                Hen. You can quote me on that!"</p>
            <p class="fun">"Join us for a weekend away at some of our friends." </p>
            <p class="attentiongrab">"Anyway, about time I got on with some <em>proper</em> work!"</p>
        </blockquote>
