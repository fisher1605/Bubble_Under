           <p>This turtle was spotted swiming around the great barrier reef quite gracefully, despite having
               had a large chunk taken out of its right side, presumably in a shark attack.

           <p>A lovely blue starfish lay within the bed, surrounded by fantastic colours, making it the perfect picture!

           <p>This is a truely magnificent site to behold, the colours bursting out of the bed mixed with the colours of the fish, it's just purely breathtaking!

           <p>A horrowing site, of what is suspected to be how water pollution is affecting the bottom of our oceans.
